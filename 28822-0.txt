Winston Churchill (1871-1947)

(The American Author who is not related to the British Sir Winston)

A Sketch of his Life and Work

This sketch was released by THE MACMILLAN COMPANY as part of a document
to promote Churchill's 1913 novel, "The Inside of the Cup."

Mr. Winston Churchill, the author of "The Inside of the Cup," "The
Modern Chronicle," "Mr. Crewe's Career," "Coniston," "Richard Carvel,"
"The Crisis," and "The Crossing," was born in St. Louis, Mo., November
10, 1871. He is the oldest son of Edwin Spaulding Churchill of Portland,
Me., and Emma Bell Blaine, of St. Louis. The first sixteen years of his
life he spent in his native city, which was in fact his home until he
built Harlakenden House, his present residence at Cornish, N. H. In St.
Louis, it will be remembered, the opening scenes of "The Crisis" are
laid; and St. Louis again formed the objective point of Mr. Churchill's
next novel, "The Crossing." From Smith Academy in St. Louis he went to
the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.

Winston Churchill had not been a year at the Naval Academy before he
became interested in American history and American problems, and before
he finished his course he had made up his mind to devote his life and
energies to these--not only with the pen, but as an active participant.
Much of the atmosphere and some of the material for "Richard Carvel" he
gathered while still a midshipman at the Naval Academy; and in the brief
intervals between scientific studies and drills he began to read some of
the history which he afterwards used.

He resigned from the Navy on his graduation, worked for a time on the
Army and Navy Journal, and then joined the staff of The Cosmopolitan.
While he lived at Irvington-on-the-Hudson, working steadily on the
magazine, he continued his experience with fiction. He never tried to
publish any of his first work, and it is not now in existence. That year
(1895) he married Miss Mabel Harlakenden Hall, of St. Louis; and not
long after established his home at Cornish.

He found himself at this time in a fairly enviable position. He was not
obliged to spend his life doing hack-work, and could take abundant
leisure to perfect any piece of writing which he undertook. However, he
united with his rare good fortune much rare good sense. He best
illustrated the familiar paradox that genius is a capacity for taking
infinite pains. He approached his work with an inexhaustible patience, a
dogged determination to be true to his own high exactions, both in style
and substance.

Before he began "Richard Carvel," and also while it was on the stocks,
he visited Virginia and Maryland, and studied the country and the old
records with great thoroughness. He also read a vast amount of history
and other literature which gave the spirit of the period. During the
seven or eight months in '98 and '99, when he was writing the book from
beginning to end for the fifth time, he was living on the Hudson, about
thirty miles from New York. During those months he worked from breakfast
to one o'clock, then for some hours after luncheon. Late in the
afternoon he would take a long horseback ride, and after dinner he would
go at his work again, continuing sometimes far into the night. In the
midst of his work on "Richard Carvel," while he was staying at Lake
George, he ran out of historical material, and wrote "The Celebrity."
This novel was the subject of a great deal of comment on its first
appearance in 1897, and many people still regard it as the brightest and
most amusing and original piece of work which Mr. Churchill has done.

After finishing his work on "Richard Carvel," Mr. Churchill, in the
spring of 1899, went to live at Cornish, N. H., where he had purchased a
large farm on high ground on the banks of the Connecticut, just opposite
Windsor, Vt. On the estate which he had bought Mr. Churchill then built
Harlakenden House, which is modelled upon one of the mansions of
Colonial Maryland. In 1913 Harlakenden House was selected by President
Woodrow Wilson as his summer residence.

It was here that news of the great success of "Richard Carvel" came to
Mr. Churchill.

The novel immediately became the most popular book in the United States,
and was more widely read and discussed during its first year than has
been the case with any other book ever published.

"Richard Carvel" contains the great historical figures of Charles James
Fox and John Paul Jones. Perhaps the most thrilling and vividly written
passage in the book is that which describes the memorable battle between
the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis. It was this that was accountable
for the revival of interest in John Paul Jones and led to the finding of
his burial place in France and to several biographies written largely
under the stimulus of his character and personality as graphically
revealed in "Richard Carvel."

Two or three years later "The Crisis" appeared. This time Mr. Churchill
chose for his background the stirring days of the Civil War, through
some of its most thrilling events his hero passes. He incidently painted
supremely good pictures of Lincoln and Grant, showing how they grew out
of the conditions that produced the crisis, and how they dominated it
and brought it to such an issue that the country became better, greater
and stronger for the cataclysm that had threatened to disrupt it. Like
"Richard Carvel," "The Crisis" was dramatized, and opened its successful
run on the stage a few months after the book's publication.

Mr. Churchill's next book, in the series of historical romances which he
began with "Richard Carvel," is entitled "The Crossing" and was
published in the spring of 1904. Its title refers to the crossing of the
Alleghanies by the tide of the American immigration after the
Revolutionary War. No annals in the world's history are more wonderful
than the story of this conquest of Kentucky and Tennessee by the
pioneers. In "The Crossing" Mr. Churchill caught the wonder of that
adventurous phase in our early history and made of it what many consider
his most delighting romance.

Meanwhile Mr. Churchill had become actively interested in politics. In
the year 1903 he became a member of the New Hampshire Legislature. The
direct outgrowth of Mr. Churchill's interest and experiences in politics
were two important novels, "Coniston" and "Mr. Crewe's Career."

In "Coniston"--that great prose epic of political corruption as it
existed in New England a generation or more ago--Mr. Churchill showed
his ability to write of contemporary life with a vigor and understanding
which were not surpassed in any of his other work. "Coniston" has a big,
vital, political issue for background and a unique and dominant
character for central interest. "Jethro Bass" was a farmer by origin,
taciturn, inscrutable, with his streak of sardonic humor and his slight,
unforgetable stammer, was heralded as the most important figure Mr.
Churchill had ever drawn.

Two years later "Mr. Crewe's Career" was published, to meet with instant
success. It was a further embodiment of Mr. Churchill's observations and
experiences among the people of the political whirlpool, and showed his
increasing power as a novelist of contemporary life. The business of
politics, the sordid struggles of an election are described with a
graphic pen. Rarely has an American author portrayed with such judicial
calm and yet with such relentless realism, the sinister aspects of
political life in a rural community or woven into this grimy fabric, in
gold thread, a charming love story that goes far to make us forget the
ugly and hateful features of the picture.

It will be seen how, since the publication of "Richard Carvel," Mr.
Churchill's themes move in orderly sequence from Colonial days until
each represents the actual life and atmosphere of distinct periods in
American history. It was "A Modern Chronicle" that brought Mr.
Churchill's work to the heart of the present. The new novel dealt with
the social problems of the marriage condition, the imperfect
civilization of ultra-fashionable life, with its frequent climax of
divorce. Heretofore Mr. Churchill's leading characters are men, but in
"A Modern Chronicle" he gives us a woman--Honora Leffingwell--
fascinating, full of illogical moods and caprices, who, taken from start
to finish, is a most consistent and convincing piece of
characterization.

With the day of its publication, in 1910, "The Modern Chronicle" headed
the list of "Books Most in Demand" at the libraries and the Bookman list
of "Six Best Sellers" in almost every large city of this country. Its
success was confined not only to this side of the water but in Great
Britain, as well; the book was in great demand. These conditions were
due to the fact of the author's established reputation with the great
majority of American and English readers, and to the merits of a work
which received almost unanimous appreciation from the press of both
countries.

Three years have passed since the tremendous success of "A Modern
Chronicle," and during this time Mr. Churchill has worked upon and
completed the novel which, perhaps more than any other, will create
discussion and admiration and go furthest to assure the author's
reputation as the biggest literary figure in America to-day.

"The Inside of the Cup," Mr. Churchill's latest novel, may be rightly
called the sum of his genius. It contains the same art of his former
work, broadened, enriched and matured, and reflects the romance of
"Richard Carvel," the realism of "Coniston," and the deep social
significance of "A Modern Chronicle." From a masterly delineation of the
personal history of a young clergyman and the transformation of his
views and attitudes toward modern society, Mr. Churchill unfolds a
powerful study of the present tendencies in the Church and their new
relation to the life of to-day.

"The Inside of the Cup" is unquestionably the most impressive novel that
Mr. Churchill has yet written, in character drawing and illuminative
disclosures of the cross sections of society, and in the portrayal of
their more delicate and crucial relation to conditions vital to the
national welfare.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one
owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission
and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the
General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the Project
Gutenberg™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered
trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you
receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of
this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this
eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and
given away--you may do practically anything with public domain eBooks.
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially
commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

Please read this before you distribute or use this work.

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg™ License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic
work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept
all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the
terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all
copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you
paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™
electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this
agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you
paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be used
on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™
electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See
paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you
from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works
by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms
of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated
with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the
copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost
no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with
the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work,
you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through
1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg ™ License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless
you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access
to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that

 •  You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the
owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to donate
royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each
date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your
periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such
and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
 •  You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does
not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You must
require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works
possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access
to other copies of Project Gutenberg ™ works.
 •  You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
receipt of the work.
 •  You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth
in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the
owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection.
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the
medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right of
Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. You agree
that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of
warranty or breach of contract except those provided in Paragraph F3.
You agree that the Foundation, the trademark owner, and any distributor
under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual, direct,
indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages even if you give
notice of the possibility of such damage.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a defect
in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written
explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received
the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your
written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', with no other
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg ™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's™ goals
and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn
more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how
your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://pglaf.org.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
